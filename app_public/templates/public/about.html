<h2>Our Journey</h2>
<h3>From an idea to a platform for change.</h3>
<p>
CampusConnect began as a discussion among students — a dream to make learning more engaging and inclusive. What started as a class project quickly turned into a living platform, shaped by teamwork, late nights, and shared vision.
</p>
<p>
Through this journey, we’ve learned that technology isn’t just about coding — it’s about people. It’s about creating something that connects hearts and minds across campuses.
